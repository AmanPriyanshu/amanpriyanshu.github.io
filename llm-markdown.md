# Aman Priyanshu - AI Researcher

## AI Researcher (Security Foundation Models - Reasoning & Instruct)

Hi, I'm Aman!

I'm an AI Researcher at[Foundation-AI](https://fdtn.ai)([Cisco](https://www.cisco.com), part of[Robust Intelligence](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/fortifying-the-future-of-security-for-ai-cisco-announces-intent-to-acquire-robust-intelligence)startup acquisition) specializing in foundation models for security applications, particularly reasoning, long-horizon planning, and agentic systems. I've trained 8B-20B parameter models across multi-node GPU clusters (50+ GPUs). My research spans AI for security, AI security, privacy-preserving ML, and LLM safety, with work deployed in production models that have seen 300K+ downloads (in 2025 alone). My AI Safety work has been featured in[SC Magazine](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/metas-promptguard-model-bypassed-by-simple-jailbreak-researchers-say),[The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/29/meta_ai_safety/), and other outlets, and led to invitations to[OpenAI's Red Teaming Network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V7x-jaOLKZyGTJNAYCH9tIwi5-zLybJJ/view?usp=sharing)and[Anthropic's Model Safety Bug Bounty Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrJK3BEZaVdvIO30q7aFIJ6z0KpyqmDu/view?usp=sharing).

With a[Masters in Privacy Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University](https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu), I've published at venues like USENIX and AAAI. I worked with[Professor Norman Sadeh](https://s3d.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/sadeh-norman.html)on LLM security research and[Niloofar Mireshghallah](https://mireshghallah.github.io/)on privacy-preserving ML. Currently, I build specialized RL environments for security domains, including custom CTF environments for automated penetration testing curriculum training and vulnerability detection frameworks for iterative code patch discovery.
