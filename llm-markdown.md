# Aman Priyanshu - AI Researcher

## AI Researcher (Security Foundation Models - Reasoning & Instruct)

Hi, I'm Aman!

I'm an AI Researcher at[Foundation-AI](https://fdtn.ai)([Cisco](https://www.cisco.com)) specializing in AI foundation models for reasoning / instruct applied within the security domain (also agentic-applications and structured-response). In my brief time as a researcher, I've been fortunate to publish in various AI conferences, journals, and workshops, with my work spanning privacy-preserving machine learning, AI security, and large language models. My focus has been on uncovering vulnerabilities in foundation models - work that has garnered media attention ([1](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/metas-promptguard-model-bypassed-by-simple-jailbreak-researchers-say),[2](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/29/meta_ai_safety/),[3](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/meta-s-latest-ai-safety-model-is-not-foolproof/story)) and led to invitations to join some really cool security initiatives like[OpenAI's Red Teaming Network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V7x-jaOLKZyGTJNAYCH9tIwi5-zLybJJ/view?usp=sharing)and[Anthropic's Model Safety Bug Bounty Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrJK3BEZaVdvIO30q7aFIJ6z0KpyqmDu/view?usp=sharing)(though couldn't participate completely due to student-visa restrictions).

With a[Masters in Privacy Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University](https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu), I've worked closely with[Professor Norman Sadeh](https://s3d.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty/sadeh-norman.html)on LLMs and cybersecurity research, while also collaborating externally with[Professor Ashique KhudaBukhsh](https://www.rit.edu/directory/axkvse-ashique-khudabukhsh)(RIT) on exploring LLM political polarization and jailbreak-assisted toxic rabbit hole evaluations. My contributions to privacy-preserving machine learning and AI safety have been recognized through the[AAAI Undergraduate Consortium Scholar](https://aaai-uc.github.io/2023_scholars.html#aman-priyanshu)and[MITACS Research Scholar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bfD2JT5ApZjmMpVEpGj5K7FtKYl7rGiz/view?usp=sharing)awards, further fueling my passion for bridging the gap between theoretical vulnerabilities and real-world implications.
